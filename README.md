YouMatter Studios Project Ewo Playable Beta

The files were too big (2GB) and therfore I was not able to upload it to github. You can play the beta using this Google Drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AWxOmQ2D49negWBMTM3YWG_VTFll6fj1?usp=sharing 
Please read more about us at https://youmatterstudios.com 

How To Play:

*Mac Users: Simply donwload the app file and run it. You may need to change your security settings for it to run *most stable platform*

*Windows Users: You must download both the Data file and the exe. The downloads should have the same name (a (1).exe will not work with a _ Data folder, it must be linked with a _ Data(1) folder) and be in the same directory for it to work. 

Othe Notes:

*The Windows build is not the most stable, to get the full experience try using a Mac

*Source code can be provided but only to recruiters. Please email contact your applicant or email foyezurmrahman@gmail.com
